# Form-Validation-in-JS
Form validation means checking user input before accepting it. It is used to make sure the information entered in a form is correct, safe, and complete.

There are two types of validation:
✔ Client-Side Validation
✔ Server-Side Validation

✅  Client-Side Validation (Frontend Validation)
This validation happens in the browser using JavaScript before the form is submitted.
Example checks: Email format correct or not , Password length , Required fields are not empty , Phone number contains only digits

Server-Side Validation (Backend Validation)
This validation happens after the form is sent to the server (Node.js, PHP, Python, Java backend, etc.).
The server checks: Valid format , Security (SQL Injection, XSS, etc.) , Correct password ,, Whether the user already exists
Even if client-side validation is done, server-side validation is still required for full security.
